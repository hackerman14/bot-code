#### Frequently Asked Questions
- <u>How do I use hackerman14?</u>
	- The default prefix is `rh!`, you can type `rh!help` for all available commands.
- <u>Why is the bot not responding?</u>
	- There can be many reasons, but here are the most common reasons:
		- It lacks permission to `Read Messages`, `Read Message History`, `Send Messages`, `View Channel`, `Connect`, `Speak`, `Use Voice Activity`. (If you don't want to add the permissions one by one, you could just give it `Administrator`!)
		- You typed the wrong prefix for the bot.
		- The command doesn't exist.
    	- You typed the command with error grammars. (For example, the command is `rh!help`, but you typed `rh!Help`.)
