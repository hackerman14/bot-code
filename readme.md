[Invite hackerman14](https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=619613322903420929&scope=bot&permissions=8) | [My Server](https://discord.gg/fy6nBMg)

A Discord bot that tries to bring "quality" content to your Discord server, ahh well hope you enjoyed it. :/

* * *

#### **World's First Problem Meme**

*	If the bot went offline, please visit [https://raymond-discord-bot.glitch.me/](https://raymond-discord-bot.glitch.me) so you can wake up the bot.
*	If the bot wasn't working, you should check the permissions for it in your server or maybe you've blocked the bot.

#### **Crappy Features**

*   Fun commands such as `rh!skeppy`, `rh!gif` etcetera.
*   Music commands so you can listen to music using the bot.
*   Useless commands such as `rh!help`, `rh!about`, etcetera.

#### **Owner's Greatest Life Tips**

*	JavaScript melts my brain
*	I totally suck at coding
*	Someone please develop Slavcord.js and it should be faster than Discord.js (just kidding)
