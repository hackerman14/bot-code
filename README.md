## Self Hosting

Yes you can, but I don't recommend you doing so, I had issues making projects work from Glitch to a localhost, but here are a few simple steps:
1. Install all packages in `package.json`
2. Put your API Tokens/Keys/Links in `.env` (I've explained what you should put in the file via the file itself)
3. Run `node index.js` to start the bot and `node deploy.js` to deploy the commands.

*(Note: Please refrain from completely making the bot look nearly the same when you use part of my codes, this isn't really nice to honestly steal people's code and renaming it to your own bot without crediting me.)*
