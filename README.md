## Self Hosting

Yes you can, but I don't recommend you doing so, but here are a few simple steps:

**Requirements**
- NodeJS with the version â‰¥ 16.6.0
- A working brain

1. Clone the repo by entering `git clone https://github.com/dumpydev/dumpyutils.git`, or just download the repo via the download button.
2. Change directory to your repo location.
3. Install all packages in `package.json` by entering `npm install`.
4. Put your API Tokens/Keys/Links in `.env` (I've explained what you should put in the file via the file itself)
5. Run `node index.js` to start the bot and `node deploy.js` to deploy the commands.

*(Note: Please refrain from completely making the bot look nearly the same when you use part of my codes without crediting me.)*
